Aftermath Wizard

Aftermath Wizard was created to help the Kodi community out and help get rid of the broken personal wizards that are floating around. As this is a work in progress, I would highly recommend the use of a repository, but if you prefer not to, there is a built-in auto-updater.

Currently, this version of the wizard supports:

If you don't see these in your menus, don't be alarmed... it's just because you dont have them installed. They are supported, however ;)
